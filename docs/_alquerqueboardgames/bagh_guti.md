## Description

Bagh Guti is a hunt game from South Asia similar to others throughout the region. It is unique, though, because the goat pieces can be stacked on one another.

## Rules

5x5 board, played on intersections, with lines forming a diamond shape connecting the midpoints of the edges of the board. One player plays with two tiger pieces, placed on the midpoints of two opposite sides. The other player plays with twenty goats, divided into four stacks of five, placed on the next adjacent spot to the tigers on the diamond. The goats move first. Goats may move one at a time to any adjacent vacant spot. The tiger may move in the same manner, but also may capture a piece by hopping over it. Multiple captures can be made on the same turn with subsequent hops, but only the top goat in a stack is captured when a tiger leaps over it. The goal of the goats is to surround the tigers so they cannot move; the goal of the tigers is to capture all the goats.
