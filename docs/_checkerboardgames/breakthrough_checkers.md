##  Description

A variant of Breakthrough played with Checkers pieces and rules (mostly).

## Rules

Checkers-Breakthrough is played on a 8 × 8 checkers board with checkers pieces. The initial board setup and basic piece movements are the same as in checkers. A checker piece can move either onto a diagonally forward adjacent empty square or jump over a diagonally adjacent opponent piece (possibly repeatedly). Unlike checkers, however, jumps are not mandatory and jumped-over pieces are not captured. The first player to reach the opponent’s backrank wins (thus no king promotions).
