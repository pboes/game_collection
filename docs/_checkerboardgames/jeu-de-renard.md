## Description

The Jeu de Renard is a hunt game played on a Draughts board from early modern France. This is the standard version, where one fox plays against twelve hens.

## Rules

8x8 Draughts board. One player plays with a single fox, the other with twelve hens, played on the white squares. The hens begin on the first three rows; the fox may begin on whatever spot the player chooses. Hens move one space forward diagonally, the fox moves one space diagonally forward or backward. The fox may capture a hen by hopping over it to an empty space diagonally on the other side of it. The hens win by blocking the fox from being able to move; the fox wins by capturing all the hens.
