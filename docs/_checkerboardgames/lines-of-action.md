## Description

Lines of Action was invented by Claude Soucie in 1969. It is played on an 8x8 board with twelve pieces per player.

## Rules

A player wins by connecting all of one's pieces into a contiguous body so that they are connected orthogonally or diagonally. Players alternate moves. Pieces move orthogonally or diagonally. A piece moves exactly as many spaces as there are pieces (belonging to both the player and their opponent) on the line in which it is moving. A piece may jump over the player's own pieces, but not over one belonging to the opponent. A piece can capture piece belonging to the opponent by landing on it.
