## Description

This mini-game (also called the Pawn Game) gives a good feel for how the pawns move, capture and defend themselves. Pawns provide the backdrop for chess. Structures such as pawn chains will emerge as well as important concepts such as the sacrifice. To play the game well requires counting ahead as pawns race each other.

## Rules

Each side has a line of pawns. The pawns move as in chess i.e. The pawn moves forwards one square (optionally two squares on its first move) and captures diagonally forwards one square by replacing the opponent’s piece. The rule of En Passant is also allowed. White goes first. The first person to reach the other side is the winner. You also win if it is your opponent’s move and they have no moves left.
In Ludii, options are also available to add each of the five other Chess piece types. In the variant with the king piece, if you capture the opponent king, you win as well.
