## Description

Wolf and Sheep is a hunt game, said to be originally derived from Scandinavian halatafl games. Played on an 8x8 checkerboard and only played on the dark squares.

## Rules

Four pieces are the sheep; they are placed on the dark squares along one side of the board. one piece is the wolf; it is placed on any dark square on the side opposite the sheep. The goal of the wolf is to reach one of the sheep's original spaces, the sheep's goal is to block the wolf from doing so. Sheep move diagonally forward one square, the wolf moves diagonally forward or backward one square.
